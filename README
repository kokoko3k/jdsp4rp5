jdsp4rp5: JamesDSP in root mode for unrooted Retroid Pocket 5
======================================================

The problem:
-----------------------------
    Retroid Pocket 5 speakers sounds really bad out of the box.
    Unfortunately, rootless equalizer solutions cannot be applied to low latency
    applications like most of the emulators, so a root solution is needed,
    but rooting the Retroid Pocket 5 voids its warranty.

    
The solution:
-----------------------------
    Leverage the ability of the RP5 to run scripts as root to configure
    the system to apply JamesDSP to every output stream.

    
Benefit/what to expect:
-----------------------------
    A dramatic improvement in sound quality from the speakers.
    A fairly linear frequency response from 400hz to 10khz.
    The equalization has been created by profiling the sound
    through a professional calibration microphone while the
    hands were "on" the console, That's the intended use.


What NOT to expect:
-----------------------------
    You won't hear anything lower than 400hz, nor did I bothered to
    make it possible, since that would have lowered the volume
    to absymal levels. RP5's little speakers are just not up to the task.


Drawbacks:
-----------------------------
    The root script execution step has to be repeated everytime RP5 boots.
    The audio output latency will increase by about 70ms.
    The output volume will be lower.
    CPU usage will be slightly higher.
    
    
ELI5, over-detailed how to:
-----------------------------
    * If you haven't already, download the zip release file.
    * Unpack it under your internal Downloads directory, so that the
      final structure will be like:
      
      RP5 Internal Storage
          L Downloads
               L jdsp4rp5  (NOT jdsp4rp5-main!)
                     L support 
                     L 00-jdsp_setup.sh
                     L ...other files
      
      WARNING: It won't work from anywhere else (without modifications).
    * Install, but don't open afterwards: JamesDSPManagerThePBone.apk from that folder.
    * From the settings menu, select:
          Handheld Settings, Advanced, Run scripts as Root, SELECT A SCRIPT
          Choose: "Downloads > jdsp4rp5": 00-jdsp_setup.sh
          Tap RUN.
    * Now let's configure the previously installed JamesDSO app, open it.
          JamesDSP Configuration:
            - Set Limiter threshold: -0.10dB
            - Set Limiter release: 500.00ms
            - Set Post gain: 15.00dB
            - Enable Arbitrary response equalizer.
            - Tap on the underlying graph.
            - Tap "Edit as string".
            - Paste the content of the file: GraphicEQ.txt 
              (something like: GraphicEQ: 480 0; 600 -5;....)
            - Confirm by tapping OK.
            - Go back.
            - Tap the cog icon in the lower/left side of the screen
            - Select Audio processing, enable "Legacy mode".
            - Go back, back.
            - Finally enable the audio processing by clicking on the PowerOn/Off icon.
    
    * Play something!


Further notes:
-----------------------------
    * As explained, this method does not survive a reboot.
      However, you don't have to repeat the *whole* setup everytime,
      but just the "run script as root -> 00-jdsp_setup.sh" part.
      On this subject, since I prefer to power down my device over night,
      I find convenient to add a shortcut for the Handheld setting on my
      home screen.
      For the task, I used "Activity Launcher" app to create a shortcut to:
      Handheld Settings -> com.ro.settings.activity.MainSettingsActivity
      
    * To restore the original state of your RP5, either reboot it
      or Run script as root: 99-jdsp_cleanup.sh
      Note that JamesDSP and its configuration will stay.
      
    * Since the equalization process lowers the output volume, 
      we have set JamesDSP to continuously push the volume as high as possible.
      If sound keep increasing and decreasing too much, just lower the
      RP5 volume by operating on its volume buttons.
      You may need to adjust it depending on the content it is playing.

    * Install location:
      As explained before, the whole thing will not work if not installed under
      Internal storage/Downloads location, this is due to a limitation in
      "Run script as root" feature.
      It is still possible to change the installed location if you edit the
      files: 00-jdsp_setup.sh and 99-jdsp_cleanup.sh
      You have to search for occurrences of: "/data/media/0/Download/"
      and replace them by "/data/media/0/something/else/of/your/choice".
      > It is Really important that you use /data/media/0 as the start path. <
